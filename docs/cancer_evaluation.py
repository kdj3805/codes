# # cancer_evaluation.py  v3.0  FINAL
# #
# # REQUIRES (run these two commands first):
# #   pip uninstall ragas -y
# #   pip install "ragas==0.2.6"
# #
# # WHY: Your installed ragas 0.4.3 is the vibrantlabsai FORK, not the official
# # explodinggradients/ragas. The fork's Faithfulness class does NOT inherit from
# # ragas.metrics.base.Metric, so evaluate() always rejects it with:
# #   "All metrics must be initialised metric objects"
# # Official ragas 0.2.6 uses module-level singleton metrics that DO pass the
# # isinstance(m, Metric) check inside evaluate().
# #
# # CONFIRMED WORKING PATTERN (from ragas_test.py API inspection):
# #   from ragas.metrics import faithfulness, answer_relevancy, ...
# #   result = evaluate(dataset, metrics=[faithfulness,...], llm=ragas_llm, embeddings=ragas_emb)
# #
# # HOW TO RUN:
# #   python cancer_evaluation.py --quick           # 5 questions ~8 min
# #   python cancer_evaluation.py                   # 20 questions ~30 min
# #   python cancer_evaluation.py --category graph  # one category
# #   python cancer_evaluation.py --label v5_1      # labelled run
